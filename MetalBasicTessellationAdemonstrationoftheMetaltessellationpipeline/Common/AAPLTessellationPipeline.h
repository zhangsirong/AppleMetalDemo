    Abstract:
    Tessellation Pipeline for MetalBasicTessellation.
            The exposed properties are user-defined via the ViewController UI elements.
            The compute pipelines are built with a compute kernel (one for triangle patches; one for quad patches).
            The render pipelines are built with a post-tessellation vertex function (one for triangle patches; one for quad patches) and a fragment function. The render pipeline descriptor also configures tessellation-specific properties.
            The tessellation factors buffer is dynamically populated by the compute kernel.
            The control points buffer is populated with static position data.
